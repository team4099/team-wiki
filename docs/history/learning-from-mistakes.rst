Learning from our Mistakes
==========================

Summary
-------

This page contains the team history in terms of things we've done well in the 
past and things we should try to improve upon. The objective of this page as a 
whole is to ensure that we don't rely on veteran members' memories to make sure
we know what types of mistakes we may be prone to.


2015: Recycle Rush
------------------

`Recycle Rush <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recycle_Rush>`_, while widely considered the worst FRC game in history, was `not a 
bad year for our team <https://www.thebluealliance.com/team/4099/2015>`_. This 
was the highest ranking coming out of qualification matches that our team had 
ever placed in, and the robot generally did what it was supposed to. With that
said, there was definitely a lot of room for improvement.

Things We Did Well
******************

- Ranked relatively highly competitively

- Robust robot (no major component failures)

  - Things were overbuilt (the claw used to stack the totes was steel angle)

  - We had a spare claw

  - Winch driven by a steel cable

- Overall simple robot

  - Single winch actuation (no other actuations outside of drive)

  - Almost entirely COTS parts

    - KOP chassis

    - AM Toughbox gearboxes for everything (winch, slide drive omni)

Things We Did Not Do Well
*************************

- Extremely slow at stacking to any reasonable level

  - Robot was not designed to be able to quickly stack from human player 
    station or from landfill

  - Elevator did not have any closed loop control

    - If I remember correctly, we actually got PID gains working and had an
      encoder on that robot, but not with enough testing time to do anything
      with it

  - No driver practice

    - As usual, robot was barely finished by bag day, and there was no 
      practice bot for drivers to test stuff with

  - Claw was slow at intaking (required precise positioning)

    - No roller claw or anything to make intaking easier

- Poor strategic analysis

  - Good teams figured out at kickoff that this game was going to be won and
    lost in elims by the recycling cans -- we didn't realize this (though at 
    this point, we had never made elims in team history, so we didn't really
    design around elims)

  - Didn't really design around a planned usual game cycle

    - If we had, we would have been better at intaking from the human player
      station

- Driving was very iffy

  - We didn't really take driver practice seriously and as a result, our drive
    team selection wasn't ideal either. We did what we usually did until 2017,
    which was basically pick a couple of seniors a little bit before comps and
    let them drive (no tryouts, no multi year drivers, no real practice)

  - We decided to use a slide drive, which didn't really work but took a ton 
    of time to get working to the level that it did

    - We had the typical slide drive issue, where the sliding omni often 
      didn't get enough traction to make the robot actually do anything

    - Controls weren't really good enough to make it worthwhile, and neither
      was practice
